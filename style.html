<h2>BIT 3434: Advanced Modeling for Business Analytics</h2>

	<p>In this class, we learned a lot about using models and analytics to solve problems in businesses. We used Excel spreadsheets to solve a lot of these problems and to make the models. We also learned about non-linear programming, heuristics, and other methods. Our final project was a team project in which we made a website about genetic algorithms, a problem-solving method based on natural selection, and how it is applied in business.  </p>

     <h2>FIN 3104: Introduction to Finance</h2>

<h2>BIT 4484: Project Management</h2>
		<p>In this class, we learned a lot about project management tools and techniques, such as Gantt charts, communications, stakeholder analyses, risks, cost management, scope statements, and more. The primary part of this class was to run our own project. My group's project was called "Hokies for the Humane Society." We worked with the Humane Society of Montgomery County, an animal shelter in Christiansburg, VA. We raised funds and awareness through percentage night events, and we raised supplies through two very successful supply drives. Our project turned out to be a greak success! </p>
